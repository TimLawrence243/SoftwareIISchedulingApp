The application accounts for time zones and assumes an Eastern Time Zone for the 'Main office' and does not allow scheduling outside of office hours.
The application also assumes an office for the company exists in Paris, France, and changing the default language on your device will translate some key text in the application to French
The application allows the creation of Customers and displays them in a table
Selecting a customer from the table brings their information into the TextFields for updating or deleting
There is report generation in the application, which can generate reports of the total appointments upcoming, a report for a specific contact's schedule, or a report for a count of ALL appointments created in the application
